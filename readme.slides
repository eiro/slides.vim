› tips: more emojis from gnome

    if you're using gnome:
     install gnome characters
     activate "characters" in gnome search
     now you can search for "pile of " to get 💩

› more tips

    just read [tips.md](https://github.com/eiro/slides.vim/blob/master/tips.md)

› Known bugs

    you can't have more than 1 emphasize in a line
    because (say X is nbsp):

        Xem1XtextXem2X

    you want to emphasize em1 and em2 but text also
    is a region between 2 X so the whole line is
    highlighted.
