› when ?

     need slides, have no time
     prototyping
     remote/collaborative display

› prototyping

    ▶ git revision
    ▶ lightweight as a text file
    ▶ autofolding: quick rearange
    ▶ WYSIWYG

› remote/collaborative display

    ▶ ssh forced command
    ▶ slides.vim + ii + tmux + ...

› cons ?

    only text, code, emojis and all unicode but ...

     vim customization (see emphasize slide)
     !eog -f  ~/slides*(o)& when things get visual

› system requirement

     a fullscreen terminal
     vim + slides.vim
     your *.slides

› which term ? (gnome terminal)

    👍 good support of 256 colors term
    👍 nice emoji rendering

› which term ? (terminology)

    👍 transparency, background
    👍 better look

› which term ? (coolretroterm)

› usage

    # install slides.vim (:h packages)
    # vim is now aware of .slides file extension

    $ vim yourtalk.slides

› insertion mappings

    (*    ┃ ▶<space>
    (-    ┃ <space>
    ("    ┃ ›<space>
    (5    ┃  <cr> <cr> <cr> <cr> <cr><esc>5kA

    " TIP: whenever you  want to edit (:h 'fen)
    :set fen!

› presentation mappings

    in normal mode

    next slide       ┃ PageDown
    last slide       ┃ PageUp
    show/hide agenda ┃ :AgendaToggle<cr>

› emphasize

    because some words are important
    you can use npsp (alt-space) to
    emphasize them.

› tips: editing

     toggle numbers and folding (switch to edition mode)
        :set nu! fen!
     next slide
        /^›

› tips: digraphs

    :h digraphs

    get the list of digraphs in a text file

        :redir > ~/digraphs.txt
        :digraphs
        :redir END
        :e ~/digraphs.txt

    define a new digraph

        " in zsh: print $[16#1F44D]
        dig +1 128077

    so now <c-k>+1 means 👍

› drawing with digraphs

    draw charts and tables can be drawn
    with digraphs:

    vv │ vertical
    hh ─ horizontal
    vh ┼ vertical and horizontal
    dh ┬ down  horizontal
    uh ┴ up    horizontal
    ld ┐ left down
    ur └ up right

    and so on ...

› drawing with digraphs: tips

    use numeral adjectives:
    5i<c-k>vv gives you ─────

    get used to <c-v> to resize cols:
    <c-v>4l8jx to remove 4 char width
    <c-v>8jx5p to add 4 char width

    5i<c-k>vv gives you ─────

    use upercase to bold:
    <c-k>vv<c-k>VV gives you │┃

› maths and digraphs

    ∀ FA    and more ... see :digraphs
    ∈ (-    also greek alphabet is available with *
    ∞ 00
    ⌠ Iu    α *a
    │ vv    β *b
    ⌡ Il    π *p
    ∑ +Z    ∏ *P
    ∏ *P

› example

    ℚ = { (𝑚 ,𝑛) | (𝑚 ,𝑛) ∈ ℤ  Χ ( ℤ \ {0} ) }

› tips: more emojis from gnome

    if you're using gnome:
     install gnome-characters and gnome-character-map
     activate "characters" in gnome search
     now you can search for "pile of " to get 💩

    just read tips.md

› Known bugs

    you can't have more than 1 emphasize in a line
    because (say X is nbsp):

        Xem1XtextXem2X

    you want to emphasize em1 and em2 but text also
    is a region between 2 X so the whole line is
    highlighted.

    i use to use slides.vim when i ran out of time.
    Nowadays, unicode symbols and emojis are randered
    nicely in terminals so i can do some nice looking
    presentations using slides.vim.

    to be confortable with slides.vim, you should be
    confortable with abbreviations (:h :iab)
    and digraphs (:h :digr) and learn about the basic ones.

    i wasn't aware of the other vim presentation.
    So the next slides are there to mention i'm aware of
    those projects but notes are probably unfair.

    pandoc can turn markdown files into
     a beamer file (latex class)
